==============


There are one program to calculate topological features:

1)       Topological_features

This is a matlab program (version MATLAB R2007b) that calculate topological features.

      

USAGE:

The entry point of the code is the script =Topological_features.m
To run the program, use the following arguments in matlab command line:

"[Features_Matrix]=Topological_features(Adj,Set,Process,T)"


options:


Adj:  The PPI network (for example you can calculate PPI network based on All interaction file ).


Set:    The vertices of all drug target proteins (you can use the no. of selected proteins or tab delimited MAT-File with n rows).


Process:  The Informative Biological Process (IBP) related to Covid-19 (tab delimited MAT-File)

T: The vertices of Proteins that tareted by virus.(tab detimited MAT-File with n names of all proteins).

Features_Matrix: The 6 topological features of each protein that targeted by All-Drug group


==============
In addition, We present a ComplexNetwork related to biological process of Sars_Covid-2 and
ProteinIDrelated to its vertices from all proteins in example.mat file.
